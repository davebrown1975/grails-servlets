# grails-servlets

This short project demonstrates how to write and wire-up traditional J2EE servlets within a Grails Application.

We are using Grails 4.0.1 for this example.

Within src/groovy you will find the custom servlet, a basic example that responds to a 'GET' request with simple JSON.

Wiring takes place via the Spring configuration file resources.groovy.
